## Introduction

The General Quiz is a multiple-choice online quiz testing the users' general knowledge of history, biology, geography, IT, movies, and sports. When playing the game, the user can create a username and choose between several difficulty levels. The user gets feedback on the number of questions in the ongoing quiz and the score.


## Project Goals

### User Goals
* The site's user wants to play an online quiz to test their general knowledge of history, biology, geography, IT, movies, and sports.

### Site Owner Goals
* The site owner aims to provide the online user with an entertaining,  fun, enlightening,  and appropriately challenging quiz.

## User Experience

### Strategy

#### Target Audience
* Users are interested in history, biology, geography, movies, and sports.
* Users are looking for entertaining and enlightening content online.


#### User Requirements and Expectations
* Simple and intuitive navigation system.
* The links work as expected.
* Immediate feedback on progress.
* Visually appealing responsive design.
* Accessibility.

#### User Stories

##### First-time User 
As a first-time user, I want to ...
1. ... easily navigate through the quiz.
2. ... get clear feedback on my score.
3. ... quickly return to the chosen level section of the game and play again.


##### Returning Users
As a returning user, I want to ...
1. ... try a higher-level game.
2. ... see my previous scores.
3. ... find out more about the game developer.

##### Site Owner
As the site owner, I want users to ...
1. ... interact with the game, stay engaged, and enjoy the challenge.

### Scope

#### Initial Stage

At the early stage, the site will include a welcome section that displays the game's rules and lets the user create a username, and then the user is given a choice of four levels of difficulty of the game. Finally, the game will start and run through 10 questions at the chosen level. An end-of-game page will then load. Here the user can opt to play the game again.

#### Future Additions

At the current stage of development, the user gets only essential feedback on their progress through a score tally below the question displayed. More feedback could be implemented in the future, such as delayed loading of the next question. During this delay, the chosen answer color background would change to indicate whether the answer was failed (red background) or correct (green background).
However, it would enhance the user's experience to save scores and keep track of progress. This could be achieved by adding a 'save score' option on the final page.
Finally, the Challenge Mode will be added, where the user will ask questions for other users. I will also add Timer for the quiz that will automatically run out. 


### Structure

#### Wireframes

The structure of the initial site will include three sections incorporated in the index.html page:

1. **Welcome Section**  displays the game's rules and asks the user to create a username to play the game.
